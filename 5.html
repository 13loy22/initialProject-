<h1><strong><em> Welcome Postelite, we are glad you've chosen to sleep in our house. Here's a bit of info written from the heart for you to get the gist about us. About our space, it's a house of friends. And it is built up as a maze. You can get around from many entrances that will lead you to random corners. There's a lot of art spread around it and vintage furniture which brings  the feeling of being in an idyllic one of a  kind special home.  We are lucky to host every time lovely people, with different backgrounds, half locals, half internationals, some studying, some working, some seizing life, who anyways gather every Friday for a delicious Shabbat dinner. Cool and valuable people, who make the place a world of its own.  

We are located 2 minutes by foot from the beach & The old City. The house is shared but have tons of private corners where you can find time for yourself . There's also a comfortable Co-working office with high speed Wi-Fi,  a magical garden with pink flowers and hammocks and a music room with a digital piano & guitar with some jam sessions here and there where we'll be happy to see you  join . Oh, and such a lovely sunset from our roof! 
We also have many types of rooms, all beautifully decorated, in a bohemian style. This is a laid-back Co-living home. Filled with Friendly vibes &  a warm atmosphere. 
We are constantly improving and still have some work to do, yes we have. But we are not just one more standard regular hotel and that is our value. We are neither a hostel. We are a big house of roomates.
The pictures of our listings are representative, we assign rooms depending on availability. There's always a chance to switch if we will have spots.</h1><strong><em>
